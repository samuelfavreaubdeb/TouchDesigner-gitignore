# TouchDesigner .gitignore

A .gitignore file for working with git and TouchDesigner.

This file will prevent the tracking of many files automatically created by TouchDesigner. Such as :

- Backup folder
- Increment files on save
- Crash autosave files
- The import cache

It will also take care of many generic files such as :

- Logs
- macOs and Windows related files
- Python cache
- IDE / code editor settings
- Executables
